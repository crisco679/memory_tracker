    <h1>What is this app?</h1>
    <div class="aboutParagraph">
    <p>I built this app with the intent of helping me to remember certain things that I
    cannot or wish to not forget about. This app can be used to store any type of data
    you wish however I intended it to be ment for small tidbits of data to remind you of
    something you were once fond of, something that made you laugh, or even a goal that
    you've set for yourself. It's ment so that in your spare time after a long time of building
    up memories in the database, you could go back and look at your memories page and
    view everything that you have chosen to store, sort of like a photo album, but with
    memories or thoughts. </p>
