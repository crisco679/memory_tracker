# memory_tracker

I built this app with the intent of helping me to remember certain things that I cannot or wish to not forget about. This app can be used to store any type of data you wish however I intended it to be meant for small tidbits of data to remind you of something you were once fond of, something that made you laugh, a goal that you've set for yourself, or even to remind you do to a chore. It's ment so that in your spare time after a long time of building up memories in the database, you could go back and look at your memories page and view everything that you have chosen to store, sort of like a photo album, but with memories or thoughts.

1. When you first reach the website you will be at the login page. If you do not have a login simply click on the register button and it will direct you to the register page where you can create an account.
2. Once you register a username it will redirect you back to the login page where you can sign in.
3. Now that you're logged in you will notice two input fields. Use these to create your memories. Notice that each time you create a new memory the memories link in the top left corner will display a number cooresponding to the number of memories that are stored inside the database for the current user.
4. Now that you have a few memories in the database, try clicking on the memories link in the top left corner. This will direct you to your memories page where everything that you have stored will be displayed.
5. If you wish to delete one of these memories for whatever reason, simply click the erase button underneath the memory.
6. If you wish to login as a different user simply click the logout link at anytime and you will be redirected back to the login page.
